Case Study 4: Air Quality Prediction in Urban Areas 
Problem Statement: Air pollution is a severe challenge in urban areas, impacting public 
health and the environment. Accurately predicting air quality levels can help city officials 
take timely actions to reduce emissions or warn the public. Traditional methods of monitoring 
air quality are limited by the number of sensors and real-time reporting. AI models can fill 
these gaps by using available sensor data combined with weather and traffic information. 
Real-Life Example: In Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world, a local 
environmental agency used AI to predict air quality indices (AQI) with a 24-hour lead time. 
By analyzing traffic, meteorological data, and pollutant levels, the model helped the city issue 
early warnings, allowing citizens to take preventive measures, such as staying indoors or 
reducing outdoor activities on high-pollution days. 
Dataset: You are provided with air quality data (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO), traffic data, and 
weather conditions over three years. 
Questions: 
1. How can machine learning models be used to predict air quality levels? 
2. Which features in the dataset are likely to have the most significant impact on air 
quality? 
3. Build a model to predict AQI for the next 24 hours. 
4. How can this model be integrated with a city's traffic management system to reduce 
pollution? 
5. Discuss the role of AI in mitigating air pollution in developing countries.
